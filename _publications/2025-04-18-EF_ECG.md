excerpt: 'This study investigates the use of 12-lead ECG signals to estimate heart ejection fraction (EF) in a rural Appalachian population. Using a range of machine learning and deep learning models—including Transformers—our analysis shows deep learning models achieve the highest performance (AUROC ~0.86), with specific multi-lead combinations improving accuracy and model interpretability providing insights into predictive features.'

This study investigates the use of 12-lead ECG signals to estimate heart ejection fraction (EF) in a rural Appalachian population. Using a range of machine learning and deep learning models—including Transformers—our analysis shows deep learning models achieve the highest performance (AUROC ~0.86), with specific multi-lead combinations improving accuracy and model interpretability providing insights into predictive features.
