We introduce TE-SSL, a time and event-aware self-supervised learning framework for Alzheimer’s disease progression analysis. By incorporating time-to-event and event data as supervisory signals, TE-SSL improves representation learning and outperforms existing SSL methods in downstream survival analysis tasks.
