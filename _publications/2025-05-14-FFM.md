excerpt: 'We propose a federated learning framework to train foundation models for gastrointestinal endoscopy imaging, allowing hospitals to collaboratively develop general-purpose models while keeping data private. Our approach is evaluated on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, demonstrating improved performance in a privacy-preserving, federated setting.'

We propose a federated learning framework to train foundation models for gastrointestinal endoscopy imaging, allowing hospitals to collaboratively develop general-purpose models while keeping data private. Our approach is evaluated on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, demonstrating improved performance in a privacy-preserving, federated setting.
