I am a Second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at West Virginia University, working with [Dr. Prashnna K. Gyawali](https://pkgyawali.com/) at the [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/gyawalilab/).
Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for four years, where I developed and deployed machine learning models across various applications.
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Pulchowk Campus (Institute of Engineering), Tribhuvan University, Nepal.

I enjoy tackling challenging problems, learning new techniques, and applying them creatively to make an impact.
Outside of research, I enjoy playing chess and can be found on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) under the username [AlinaDevkota](https://www.chess.com/member/alinadevkota).

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me via linkedin or email at: devkota.alina@gmail.com.

Research Interests
======
My research is focused on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to healthcare. My current research has focused on foundation models and privacy-preserving techniques, such as federated learning for medical imaging, particularly in gastrointestinal endoscopy.
I am also passionate about exploring broader areas of computer vision, large language models, and other applications of deep learning and machine learning.

Looking ahead, I plan to concentrate future research at the intersection of advanced computer vision and language models for medical imaging, with the goal of enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving patient outcomes.
